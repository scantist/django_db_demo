Hi Tongle,

Regarding the models.py, would you read about this?

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/
"""
Using models¶
Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django you’re going to use those models. Do this by editing your settings file and changing the INSTALLED_APPS setting to add the name of the module that contains your models.py.

For example, if the models for your application live in the module myapp.models (the package structure that is created for an application by the manage.py startapp script), INSTALLED_APPS should read, in part:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'myapp',
    #...
]"""

So Django is a framework which looks for particular file or data structure, we need to follow its design: for the database models, we need to save them into a file named "models.py"
